# Forward declarations specify function types before definition
# This enables using a function before its definition appears

double: (i32) -> i32
triple: (i32) -> i32

# Definitions must match their forward declaration types
double = (x: i32): i32 -> x * 2
triple = (x: i32): i32 -> x * 3

# Using declared functions
